## About me

I am a PhD student in the Bioengineering Department at the University of Pittsburgh. In Pittsburgh, you can find going around the city on my bike and trying to stay as active as possible. 

Before starting at Pitt, I did my undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering at the Universidad del Turabo (now, Universidad Ana G. MÃ©ndez, Recinto de Gurabo) in Puerto Rico. But don't get deceived I am Venezuelan; I was able to do my undergrad studies in "La Isla del Encanto" because I got an athletic scholarship to be part of their swimming team.
